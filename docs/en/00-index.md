# Contents

**How to take this course in English.** Every sample can print its questions and output in English.
Add `JEV_LANG=en` to your `.env` file (see [.env.example](../../.env.example)), or put it in front of each command: `JEV_LANG=en npm run k07`.
Chapter code blocks show the plain command (`npm run k07`); they assume you have set `JEV_LANG=en`.

**Kyu and dan.** The chapters are ranked like martial-arts belts: **kyu** are beginner grades that count down from 10 to 4, and **dan** are expert ranks that count up from 1st to 10th.

---

Each section starts with a plain explanation built around an everyday analogy, then moves on to definitions, code and real output.
The closing "Going deeper (for pros)" block is collapsed and covers design trade-offs, failure cases and primary sources. If this is your first time, it is fine to leave it closed.

In the PDF edition, the color of the bar to the left of each section heading shows how long its content stays valid.

| Bar color | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Green | Evergreen. Stays true even when the model changes |
| Yellow | Semi-stable. Review it when something big changes |
| Red | Volatile. Changes often. For numbers, see [_generated/facts.en.md](../_generated/facts.en.md) |
