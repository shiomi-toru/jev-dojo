# 6th Dan: Build an evaluation dataset

- Time: 60 min (including labeling)
- Read first (official): [Machine learning primer](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction/machine-learning-primer)
- You will be able to: define for yourself what counts as the right answer, label 50 or more posts, and measure in numbers how much labels disagree

## The right answer is something you decide

<!-- freshness: evergreen -->

There is no universal right answer to "Is this post a complaint?"
Whether you call "The fireworks woke my baby. It would be nice if they ended a little earlier" a complaint depends on how the organizers want to run things.
Before you measure how accurate Jev is, first decide **your own right answers** and write them down.

The data is the 60 posts in [data/posts.ja.json](../../../data/posts.ja.json). An English translation of the same posts is in [data/posts.en.json](../../../data/posts.en.json); the 8th Dan uses both.

The author's example labels are in [data/labels.json](../../../data/labels.json). **They are not the ground truth. They are one person's judgment, following the guide below.**

```bash
npm run label   # label posts one at a time; if you stop, it picks up where you left off
npm run d6      # show what is in the data, and how well your labels agree with the author's example
```

Your labels are saved to `data/labels.mine.json`, and the 7th and 8th Dan use them automatically.

- 60 posts is the bare minimum for "seeing a trend". Before using this in production, take a random sample of a few hundred real posts and label them
- Label the evaluation data **before** you look at Jev's output. If you see its answers first, they will pull your judgment along
- Any skew in the posts (few complaints, only 7 first-aid posts, and so on) becomes a weakness of the measurement itself. Numbers for small classes swing a lot

## Write down the labeling rules for the posts you hesitate on

<!-- freshness: semi-stable -->

For the posts that are hard to call, write the rules down in words. Without rules, even the same person will judge differently from one day to the next.

**Complaint (isComplaint)**

- Yes: the post describes a problem, dissatisfaction, or a request for improvement. This includes indirect wording ("it would be nice if..."), sarcasm ("What a great festival"), and polite requests
- No: questions, thanks, impressions, lost-item reports, advertising
- A report of a hazard at the venue or its equipment ("a lantern looks like it is about to fall") is "yes", because it asks for something to be fixed
- A report about a person's health or injury ("someone collapsed") is "no": it is a call for help, not a complaint. Urgency handles it

**Team (department)**

| Label | Covers |
|---|---|
| honbu (main office) | the overall schedule, volunteers, trash, toilets, directions, thanks and general opinions |
| yatai (food stalls) | whether a stall is open, prices, food, stall equipment |
| kotsu (traffic and parking) | cars, bicycles, roads, buses, road closures, wheelchair routes |
| otoshimono (lost and found) | lost items, found items, pets that ran away |
| kyugo (first aid and safety) | injuries, feeling unwell, lost children, dangerous situations |
| sonota (none of the above) | posts that have nothing to do with the festival |

**Urgency (urgency)**

| Level | Rule of thumb |
|---|---|
| 2 | involves people's safety or health; needs action right now |
| 1 | someone is in trouble now, or it will get worse if left alone; should be handled today |
| 0 | can be handled later, or answered when someone has time |

**Tags (used in the 8th Dan)**: 敬語 (honorific), 主語省略 (omitted subject), 婉曲 (indirect), 皮肉 (sarcasm). Add every tag that applies (only in the author's example).

- Once the guide is written, have two people label the same posts and measure how well they agree (Cohen's κ). `npm run d6` prints the κ between your labels and the author's example
- When an item has a low κ, the problem is in the guide before it is in Jev. Line up the posts where you disagreed, add rules, and label again
- This guide is also a first draft of Jev's criteria (2nd Dan). A rule you cannot explain to a person will not get through to Jev either
